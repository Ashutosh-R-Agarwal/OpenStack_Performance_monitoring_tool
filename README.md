# OpenStack_Performance_monitoring_tool
Openstack is a collection of open source software project that developers
and cloud computing technologies can use to setup private clouds.
This was a sponsored project By E-Zest solutions.


Project involved studying and setting up the complete openstack server and
creating instances of it. Using Open source Apis for fetching logs in json
format from various openstack component (ceilometer) with the help of shell
scripting. Generated logs were modified to meaningful format again using
shell scripting.
The final useful logs were presented in meaningful manner using canvas along
with JavaScript for front End.
Realtime monitoring of resource instances (Ram usage, memory usage, network bandwidth usage)
was done. Using that per second billing of the user was calculated.  


Doesn't include the source code of the project since, it was designed specifically
for e-Zest solutions.
